# VSSUT Events - A College Event Management System

Initiated with the incentive to provide a common rostrum to host all college events, College Event Management (CEM) System is basically a platform where people can host their events and promote them for the students within the institute. One has to just create his/her account in CEM, then login to host his/her event and manage it as per his/her requirements. The entire process will save lot of time along with providing a better reach to the participants.

This repository is for the backend development of the project. The API of the system is well developed and it takes very less time for the website to get loaded. It provides adaptability to every kind of search engines and there is rarely any server issue noticed till date.
